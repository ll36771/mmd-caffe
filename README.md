# mmd-caffe

This is the implementation of ICML paper "Learning Transferable Features with Deep Adaptation Networks". We fork the repository with version ID `c6414ea` from [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) and make our modifications. The main modifications are listed as follow:

- Change the label from a single integer to a tuple, which contains the origin label and an indicator to distinguish source and target
- Add mmd layer described in the paper to neuron layers

Training Model
---------------

In `models/icml/amazon_to_webcam_common_setting`, we give an example model based on Alexnet. In this model, we insert mmd layers  after inception fc7 and fc8 individually.

The `bvlc_reference_caffenet` is used as the pre-trained model.

Data Preparation
---------------
In `data/office/amazon_to_webcam_common_setting/*.txt`, we give an example to show how to prepare the train and test data file. In this task, `amazon` dataset is the source domain and `webcam` dataset is the target domain. For training data in source domain, it's label looks like `(-1, origin_label)`. For training data in target domain, it's label looks like `(origin_label, -1)`. For testing data, it's label looks like `(origin_label, -1)`. Integer `-1` is used to distinguish source and target during training and testing, and `origin_label` is the acutal label of the image.

For semi-supervised tasks, the label of labeled target data looks like `(I, origin_label)`. `I` is any positive integer (larger than the number of classes) and should be added to `ignore_label` of entropy loss layer.

Parameter Tuning
---------------
In mmd-layer, parameter `iter_of_epoch` should be set to tell mmd layer when to update data. Practically, `iter_of_epoch = (source_num + target_num) / batch_size`. Users only need to tune `mmd_lambda` parameter.

Dependency
---------------
We use [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org) to solve Quadratic Programming problem when updating `beta`. Please install it before compiling this code. We add CGAL as LIBRARIES in `Makefile`. However, if you prefer to compile caffe with `cmake`, maybe you should config CGAL yourself.
